### Lab Programs
All the lab programs start with prefix 'pgm', Other extra programs have numbered name or don't start with pgm. 

### getposix.sh
This script generates a C program which lists all the compile time posix constants.

### getsc.sh
This script generates a C program which lists all run time sysconf constants.

### getconst.sh
This script outputs a list of matching pattern in a included header file (recursively checks in included files in header).
This is useful to get constants defined in an header without knowing which file its actually defined in.
